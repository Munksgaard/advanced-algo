\subsection{Tour lengths of problems}

We encountered an error in our implementation that resulted in the first
graph giving a wrong solution (though not farm apart from the right one). The
implementation works perfectly on the second and third example graphs though.
The results are gathered and can be found in the table below.

    \textbf{Graph} & \textbf{\# evaluations} & \textbf{Tour taken} & \textbf{Length}\\

    1 & 18524 & 8, 7, 5, 6 & $4.9962$ \\
    \hline
    2 & 56    & 3, 5, 4, 2 & $4.0000$ \\

    3 & 32    & 2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 3, 1, 0 & $8.0000$ \\
