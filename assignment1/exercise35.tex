\subsection{}

We want to translate the different properties of the rectilinear graph
into a minimum-cost-flow problem. Unfortunately we have not had the
time to complete this exercise, and though we have somewhat of an idea
of how to do it, we also have some questions with regards to the
exercise, which we'll probably seek to ask about during next weeks
tutorial classes.
